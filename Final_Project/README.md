# Food Recommender System based on Behavior SequenceTransformers
## Final project by Erik Nickel, Arne Klages and Jan-Luca Schr√∂der

## Readme
This readme explaines the structures of our final project.
This folder contains our model and files concerning our final project for the course "Implementing ANNs with TensorFlow" in the winter term 2021/22.

## Trained model
The trained model can be found at 'https://myshare.uni-osnabrueck.de/f/667006a24d4140cf8fdd/', as it could not be uploaded here due to size limitations.

## Requirements
The requirements for this project can be found in requirements.txt.

## Dataset
The dataset we used can be found at 'https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shuyangli94/food-com-recipes-and-user-interactions'.
We used the 'RAW_interactions.csv', 'RAW_interactions.csv' and 'PP_recipes.csv' to create our dataset.

RAW_recipes.csv

## Training the model
The model can be trained when running training.py.

## Visualisation
The TensorBoards-logs can be viewed via the 'training_visualisation.ipynb' file.

## Final report
The final paper is stored as 'Food_Recommender_System_based_on_Behavior_Sequence.pdf'
